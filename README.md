# Retina Blood Vessel Segmentation using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **automatic segmentation of retinal blood vessels** from fundus images using **deep learning techniques**. Accurate blood vessel segmentation plays a critical role in the early diagnosis of ophthalmic diseases such as **diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and hypertension**.

The model learns to identify fine-grained vessel structures by analyzing medical retinal images and produces precise segmentation masks that highlight blood vessel regions.
